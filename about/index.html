    <h1>About</h1>
    <p> Welcome to my page, where I hope to be able to share new things I come across during my work and studies.</p>
    <p> 
        I am currently a Software Developer in Montreal, working in the Advertising Technology field.  I am 
        also doing my Masters in Applied Computer Science at Concordia University.
    </p>
    <p>
        I enjoy learning and reading about all topics, and love sharing this knowledge with all those willing to hear me out.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am using this website as an outlet to improve my writing and sharing skills, so feel free to email me or reach out to me at my github <a href="https://github.com/alkhatib/Feedback/issues/new">feedback</a> page with any suggestions.
    </p>
    <p>Additionally I plan on summarising what I learn from the various software/technology books I read. I find that helps me solidify my understanding and makes it easier to rememeber.</p>
    <p>Thanks, </p>
    <p>Anas Alkhatib </p>
